					    <h5>Computer Science Principles</h5>
					    <h5>September 2018 - October 2018</h5>
					    <p class="py-5">The main goal of this project was to show our programming skills in block based code through Scratch by creating a game with my partners, Juan and Oleg, then customizing and documenting it. My partners and I decided to try something different and we created a 2D obstacle course game. We created something like Mario, so we named our project Marriiiooo 2. Our game can be controlled by the arrows keys, and uses space to attack. The goal is simple, get to the door. The main work I did was the animations with characters, weapons, and the levels. Together, we had to work through the many glitches and problems, like keeping the character on top of the platforms, running animations, and introducing gravity. Overall, this project was challenging, but allowed us to learn the basics and nuances of creating a game.

					    <h5>Computer Science Principles</h5>
					    <h5>November 2018 - December 2018</h5>
						  <p class="py-5">The main goal of this project was to show off our python programming skills with loops and if statements. This project was done with my partner Arin Manohar. The objective was to create a hangman game which allows the user to give input and actually play hangman with different themes as well. We decided to do some extra things, so we created two different themes, and multiple randomly generated words with difficulty levels as well. Our game is just using user input from the keyboard. In order to stop it from crashing, we had to develop an error handling function which made sure the inputs were letters, and also made sure that it was the right word in general. A few challenges we had were creating the error handling software, implementing it, and also creating the program with only recursive loops as a challenge. All in all, it was both a fun and interesting challenge which allowed us to show off our skills. Find the documentation here </p>

					    <h5>Honors Principles of Engineering</h5>
					    <h5>August 2019 - October 2019</h5>
						  <p class="py-5">This project was made to address the problem of cracking eggs. One of the nuances of cracking eggs is that they get your hands dirty very easily, and they also require a great amount of force to crack. This machine required me and my group to work together and come up with a device that would combat these problems. As one of the designers, I helped to create the sprocket and chain mechanism, and the gear train itself. This project required us to work together and combine our parts in order to make a successful project. By the end, we were able to put our parts together into one piece which can crack an egg using a claw, a speed gear train, and other moving parts to move a blade. All in all this project allowed us to display our design skills and creativity as well.
